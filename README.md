# Web3 Development with Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)

Welcome to my Web3 development project, leveraging the power of the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)** to build decentralized, scalable, and secure web applications. This project showcases my expertise in creating robust full-stack solutions with a focus on Web3 technologies using **Azle**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Built with **Azle**, a TypeScript framework for ICP, the project integrates modern tools and technologies to deliver efficient and secure Web3 solutions.

### Key Features
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Powered by ICP for tamper-proof, serverless applications.
- **TypeScript with Azle**: Write smart contracts (canisters) in TypeScript for robust and type-safe code.
- **GraphQL Integration**: Utilize **Apollo GraphQL** for flexible and efficient API queries.
- **Database**: Lightweight data storage with **SQLite** for on-chain persistence.
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Combines front-end (ReactJS) and back-end (Node.js) with Web3 functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Web3 Framework**: Azle (for ICP canister development)
- **Frontend**: ReactJS
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **API**: Apollo GraphQL
- **Database**: SQLite
